# IoT-Based Bird Repellent System

This project is an **IoT-based bird repellent system** that protects crops in real-time.

**How it works:**
- PIR sensors detect bird movement across the farm.
- ESP32 microcontroller activates buzzers or ultrasonic emitters to scare birds away.
- Event data is sent via Wi-Fi to a cloud platform for analysis.
- Farmers receive instant alerts on their mobile app to monitor bird activity.

This system is automated, eco-friendly, and helps reduce crop damage efficiently.
