# IoT-Based Bird Repellent System

The **IoT-Based Bird Repellent System** is designed to protect crops by detecting and deterring birds in real-time.  

**How it Works:**  
- **PIR sensors** placed across the farm detect bird movement.  
- The sensors send signals to an **ESP32 microcontroller**, which immediately activates repelling devices such as **buzzers or ultrasonic sound emitters** to scare the birds away.  
- The ESP32 sends the event data via **Wi-Fi** to a **cloud platform**, where it is recorded and analyzed.  
- Farmers receive **instant alerts or notifications** on their mobile app, allowing them to monitor and manage bird activity **in real-time**.  

This system is an **automated, efficient, and eco-friendly solution** to reduce crop damage without harming the birds.
